# COMP001B.Final-Project
Author: Matthew Tan
Purpose: This is the final project that displays our current knowledge of CSS learnt throughout the year by only editing two switchable stylesheets changing the visual design of the preestablished index.html given. This project should show the fluidity of CSS fundamentals used in a "production-ready" manner.
